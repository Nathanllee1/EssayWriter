In the Lion King, Mufasa explains to Simba the circle of life: â€œwhen we die, our bodies become the grass, and the antelope eat the grass." When Scar murdered Mufasa, he threw him into a gorge. There's no grass in the gorge, antelope don't go into the gorge, Mufasa never completed the circle of life.
